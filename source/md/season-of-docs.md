# SymbiFlow - Google Season of Docs

Google Season of Docs is a program aiming to expand the reach of open source
by bringing together open source and technical writers communities, with good
documentation being a primary facilitating factor in this process. As part of
the program we are looking for ambitious technical writers who would like to
use this opportunity to get involved in our open source FPGA toolchain project,
SymbiFlow, and contribute to work that will revolutionize the FPGA landscape
by enabling new, more software-oriented workflows and more vendor-neutral,
collaborative, modular and open development.

## Step 0 - Prior reading

It is best to start off by reading the Google Season of Docs
[Introduction](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs),
particularly the
[Technical writer section](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide).
It provides a lot of useful information about the program and terms of
participation. This is where you can register as a technical writer for
Google Season of Docs.

It is also worthwhile to take a look at the Google Season of Docs
[FAQ](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/faq),
where your questions might have already been answered.

## Step 1 - Finding an idea

Although you are welcome to come up with your own idea for a documentation-related
project that would help SymbiFlow expand, we decided to give you a few
suggestions on how you can contribute below. The list of all project ideas will
become available [here](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants)
on May 11. Once (or even before) you have selected the project, contact us
to talk about it - this can really help your application.

Suggested project ideas are listed on our ideas list, and they should have the appropriate
[season-of-docs tag](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/labels/season-of-docs).

## Step 2 - Writing your application

Applications open on June 9, 2020. Apart from filling in the form with your
basic personal info, you will need to:

 * provide your most recent technical writing experience along with
   a description of your responsibilities
 * choose the organization you want to work with and get familiar with
   the list of their project ideas (or come up with your own) - contact
   the organization to talk about the project ideas
 * decide if you want to accept the stipend from Google
 * provide both a short and a detailed description of your selected project,
   including its goal and a summary of your discussion with the organization
 * pay attention to the language of your application

You will find more information on the Google Season of Docs
[Technical writing application guide](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-application-hints) page.

## Step 3 - Community bonding

Once your application has been accepted, the mentors from your selected
organization will help you get acquainted with the open source project
and the community. During this phase you will:

 * set up direct and reliable communication channels with your mentor
   and the organization administrators
 * become familiar with the open source organization’s tools and processes
 * get a solid grip of the project by discussing it with your mentor
 * determine your and your organization’s goals and expectations

## Step 4 - Documentation development and project finalization

In this phase, which starts on September 14, 2020, you will be working under
close guidance of your mentors and:

 * complete the project, adhering to the open source community’s procedures
 * inform the organization about potential problems that affect your project
 * write a project report containing a link to your work
 * ask your mentor to review the report
 * evaluate your mentor and share your impressions of the Google Season of Docs
   program
