<h1>SymbiFlow</h1>
<p>SymbiFlow will be a FOSS Verilog-to-Bitstream FPGA synthesis flow for Xilinx
7-Series, Lattice iCE40 and Lattice ECP5 FPGAs. It is under construction. This page describes briefly
what we are up to.</p>

<h3>Project X-Ray</h3>
<p>Project X-Ray aims at documenting the Xilinx 7-series bit-stream format, a
prerequisite to building Open Source tools to generate bit-streams for those
devices. The information currently on this page is a sneak preview for the kind
of information Project X-Ray will provide.</p>

<p>Currently the work focuses on the Artix-7 xc7a50tfgg484-1 device. But we
hope to be able to provide documentation for all Xilinx 7-Series, UltraScale,
and UltraScale+ devices in the long term.</p>

<p>Right now we focus on the region SLICE_X12Y100:SLICE_X27Y149 on the xc7a50tfgg484-1
device (configuration frames 0x00020500:0x000208ff). The immediate goal of the project is to
provide tools to create bit-streams for partial reconfiguration of this region only.</p>

<p>The documentation is available in two formats:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/prjxray-db/artix7/">Human-readable HTML files</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjxray-db/">Machine-readable ASCII files</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We will update the information on this page and provide more documentation
on the format we use to document the bit-stream in the near future.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow/">our github page</a>
if you want to peek at our methodology. The short description is this: We run
many small designs through Vivado and use the TCL API to constrain the designs
so that they have certain properties, then read the generated bit-streams and
run a simple statistical analysis to correlate the bit-stream bits with
features in the test designs.</p>

<p>More documentation can be found published on <a href="http://prjxray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">prjxray ReadTheDocs site</a> - this includes:<br>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://prjxray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/overview.html">Highlevel Bitstream Architecture</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://prjxray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/db_dev_process/overview.html">Overview of DB Development Process</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Project X-Ray also includes command line tools for reading / writing Xilinx bit-stream files and converting them to / from simpler-to-process text-based formats.</p>

<h3>Project Trellis</h3>
<p>Project Trellis aims at documenting the Lattice ECP5 bit-stream, so that Open Source
tools can be built. Project Trellis currently contains enough bitstream documentation to
generate simple test bitstreams - including complete documentation for logic and interconnect tiles, and
partial documentation for IO and EBR tiles. Work is ongoing to document more advanced parts of the ECP5 such as PLLs and DSPs.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Project Trellis applies to all ECP5 parts and may also apply to related Lattice parts such as the CrossLink FPGAs. Currently the complete global network routing is documented only for the 45k device, but we hope to add this for the other ECP5 parts soon.</p>
<p>The documentation is available in two formats:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/prjtrellis-db/">Human-readable HTML files</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjtrellis-db/">Machine-readable ASCII files</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>More documentation can be found published on the <a href="http://prjtrellis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">prjtrellis ReadTheDocs site</a>.</p>
<h3>Project IceStorm</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/">Project IceStorm</a> is a previous
project that documented the iCE40 bit-stream format. It will become a part
of SymbiFlow. SymbiFlow will support the old Yosys-ArachnePnr-IceStorm flow but
will also add a Yosys-VPR-IceStorm flow.</p>
