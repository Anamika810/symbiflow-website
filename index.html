<h1>SymbiFlow</h1>
<p>SymbiFlow will be a FOSS Verilog-to-Bitstream FPGA synthesis flow for Xilinx
7-Series FPGAs and iCE40. It is under construction. This page describes briefly
what we are up to.</p>

<h3>Project X-Ray</h3>
<p>Project X-Ray aims at documenting the Xilinx 7-series bit-stream format, a
prerequisite to building Open Source tools to generate bit-streams for those
devices. The information currently on this page is a sneak preview for the kind
of information Project X-Ray will provide.</p>

<p>Currently the work focuses on the Artix-7 xc7a50tfgg484-1 device. But we
hope to be able to provide documentation for all Xilinx 7-Series, UltraScale,
and UltraScale+ devices in the long term.</p>

<p>Right now we focus on the region SLICE_X12Y100:SLICE_X27Y149 on the xc7a50tfgg484-1
device (configuration frames 0x00020500:0x000208ff). The immediate goal of the project is to
provide tools to create bit-streams for partial reconfiguration of this region only.</p>

<p>The documentation is available in two formats:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://symbiflow.github.io/prjxray-db/artix7/">Human-readable HTML files</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjxray-db/">Machine-readable ASCII files</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We will update the information on this page and provide more documentation
on the format we use to document the bit-stream in the near future.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/SymbiFlow/">our github page</a>
if you want to peek at our methodology. The short description is this: We run
many small designs through Vivado and use the TCL API to constrain the designs
so that they have certain properties, then read the generated bit-streams and
run a simple statistical analysis to correlate the bit-stream bits with
features in the test designs.</p>

<p>More documentation can be found published on <a href="http://prjxray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">prjxray ReadTheDocs site</a> - this includes:<br>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://prjxray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/overview.html">Highlevel Bitstream Architecture</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://prjxray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/db_dev_process/overview.html">Overview of DB Development Process</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Project X-Ray also includes command line tools for reading / writing Xilinx bit-stream files and converting them to / from simpler-to-process text-based formats.</p>

<h3>Project IceStorm</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/">Project IceStorm</a> is a previous
project that documented the iCE40 bit-stream format. It will become a part
of SymbiFlow. SymbiFlow will support the old Yosys-ArachnePnr-IceStorm flow but
will also add a Yosys-VPR-IceStorm flow.</p>
